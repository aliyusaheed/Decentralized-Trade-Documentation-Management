a# Decentralized Trade Documentation Management

A blockchain-based system for managing international trade documentation using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized system for managing trade documentation, verifying exporters, ensuring customs compliance, and authorizing payments. It consists of four main smart contracts that work together to create a trustless environment for international trade.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Exporter Verification Contract

This contract validates seller credentials and history:
- Register and verify exporters
- Track exporter ratings and transaction history
- Provide verification status for other contracts

### 2. Document Certification Contract

This contract verifies the authenticity of trade documents:
- Register trade documents (invoices, packing lists, bills of lading, etc.)
- Verify document authenticity using hash verification
- Track document verification status

### 3. Customs Compliance Contract

This contract ensures adherence to import/export regulations:
- Register shipments with customs information
- Track document completeness for customs
- Provide customs approval status

### 4. Payment Authorization Contract

This contract releases funds when documentation is complete:
- Register payment details for shipments
- Track document verification and customs approval status
- Authorize payment release when all conditions are met
